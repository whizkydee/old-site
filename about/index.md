Hi there. I'm Olaolu &ndash; I shouldn't still be saying that this time; a cool teeny guy who's younger than you think, born in Lagos, Nigeria.

I discovered my love for tech and computers right from my young age &ndash; I can recall so many pictures of myself holding a mobile phone while I was young, super cool, right!?

I had always loved playing with circuits and other components of my toys and other devices, and I found myself successfully re-building them (although I destroyed some); I also loved music &ndash; Yeah, really!, I always hit every single object I came across and loved songs. After my dad discovered my passion, he bought I and my siblings a desktop computer &ndash; 'Twas awesome!; I used to play games on the computer and eventually became a guru in my school even at my so young age.
